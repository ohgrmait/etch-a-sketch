## Self Reflections
- > Nothing significant to add after the [previous project](https://github.com/ohgrmait/rock-paper-scissors) except that this was much harder and getting stuff done for the extra credits was worth the time and patience. The only thing that proved to be helpful was looking at the documentation, googling, stackoverflow-"ing" and others.

[^2]: The [TOP strategy guide](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56) makes it clear to [focus on the point of the assignment](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Focus%20on%20the%20point%20of%20the%20assignment) and that [foundations isn't a strong portfolio generator](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56#:~:text=Foundations%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20strong%20portfolio%20generator), so I won't be wasting anymore time here.
